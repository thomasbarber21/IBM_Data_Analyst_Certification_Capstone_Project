# IBM Data Analyst Certification Capstone Project

The following project explores data pertaining to a Stack Overflow Survey. The project aims to replicate a real world project 
that could be assigned to a Data Analyst. The upload files contain Jupyter Notebooks that collect data from an API, 
clean, wrangle, visualize, and explore the data to deliver insights in a final dashboard and presentation.
